=head1 NAME

RWDE - Rapid Web Development Framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Subcless the RWDE::Web::AppServer module to supply your handler method
based on your CGI invocation choice (SCGI or FastCGI) then call the
Launch() method to start your application server.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 How it's different

RWDE is an application framework which is extremely small, very easy
to install because it only depends on a handful of other CPAN modules,
and quick to learn.  Unlike the other frameworks, it is designed to
work with database-based business logic -- it does not treat the DB as
a dumb store.  It is fully compatible with foreign keys, trigger-based
updates, I<etc.>, and works best with a properly normalized database
design.
