NAME
    RWDE - Rapid Web Development Framework

SYNOPSIS
    Subclass the RWDE::Web::AppServer module to supply your handler method
    based on your CGI invocation choice (SCGI or FastCGI) then call the
    Launch() method to start your application server.

DESCRIPTION
  How it's different
    RWDE is an application framework which is extremely small, very easy to
    install because it only depends on a handful of other CPAN modules, and
    quick to learn. Unlike the other frameworks, it is designed to work with
    database-based business logic -- it does not treat the DB as a dumb
    store. It is fully compatible with foreign keys, trigger-based updates,
    *etc.*, and works best with a properly normalized database design.

    Ease of installation
        Simple install via CPAN: install RWDE will pull in all necessary
        dependencies (which are minimal).

    Ease of use
        See the example applications at http://www.rwde.org/
